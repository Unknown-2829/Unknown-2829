Welcome — I'm Ayushman (widely known as Unknown or "Hacker Guru Ji"). I build experimental, high-iteration AI systems, Telegram bots, custom file tooling, and prompt engineering experiments. My work sits at the crossroads of practical automation and LLM research: fast prototypes, careful instrumentation, and visuals that look a little dangerous.

I used signals from your projects (public + private) to shape this profile while keeping private work private and never exposing sensitive details.

---

## Spotlight — Projects
(High-level overviews. I do not expose private internals.)

- telegram-DEXTER-AI — Dexter A (Uncensored AI)  
  A Python Telegram assistant/agent focused on advanced prompt control, research-first prototyping, and chat automation.

- Phantom_id & .unk-extention — Phantom Vault / .unk ecosystem  
  A custom .unk file format and companion tools (Windows app + utilities) to manage a personal file type and bespoke workflows.

- llm-prompt-engineering — AI Prompt Experiments  
  Curated collection of prompt engineering and red‑teaming experiments across modern LLMs (used for robustness, capability testing, and research).

---

## Activities on my Telegram channel
I run and maintain the "Shadow Vault" Telegram channel and associated bots. Typical activity includes:

- Announcements and release notes for Dexter AI (bot status, maintenance, relaunches, tips)
- Alpha / beta testing invitations for experimental features (image generator alpha, new models)
- Updates and releases for Phantom Vault / .unk tooling and the Phantom ID service
- System health reports, uptime and resource statistics, and developer notes
- Community polls, quick challenges, and limited-access test drops
- Support replies, bug reports, and coordination for testers

Note: I do not include or link private/potentially sensitive materials here on GitHub. Channel activity listed above is a high-level summary.

## Core skills & tech

- Python (primary) — bots, automation, tooling  
- Prompt engineering & LLM orchestration  
- Telegram API bots & real-time integrations  
- TypeScript / front-end prototypes (dashboards & control UIs)  
- Safety, red‑teaming & adversarial testing  
- Automation, logging, and observability for small services

---

## How I work

- Iterate fast: small experiments, thorough logging, rapid rollback.  
- Treat prompts like code: version, test, measure.  
- Mix research and product: prototypes that can be hardened into tools.  
- Prioritize invisible safety and clear UX for assistants.

---

## Aesthetic & Branding

This profile embraces a dark, dangerous look — skulls, bold contrast, and terse copy. Options to enhance the page:
- Animated banner (GIF or SVG) with a black/red palette  
- Demo GIFs for Telegram bot flows  
- Danger / Research badges for experimental projects  
- Icons for the .unk format and Phantom Vault app

If you want a custom banner, provide an image (or say “make an SVG banner”) and I’ll craft one.

## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Unknown-2829/Unknown-2829** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on dexter-DEXTER-AI and Phantom Vault (.unk)  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced LLM alignment and secure tooling  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on LLM safety, bot automation, and file-system tooling  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with scale testing and UI polish for Phantom Vault  
- 💬 Ask me about prompt engineering, Telegram bot internals, or custom file formats  
- 📫 How to reach me: Telegram or email above  
- 😄 Pronouns: (add if you want)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ship research-first prototypes that look dangerous but are well-instrumented
-->
