## 👤 About Me

I architect experimental AI systems at the intersection of practical automation and LLM research. I specialize in rapid prototyping, adversarial testing, and building Telegram-based AI agents. My focus is on measuring model behavior, improving safety, and turning research prototypes into reliable tools.

**Core philosophy:** iterate fast, test thoroughly, ship responsibly. Every prompt is versioned code. Every experiment informs safer deployment.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Dexter AI — Advanced Telegram Assistant (Research Platform)
*Python • Telegram API • LLM Orchestration • Safety Research*

A Telegram-based AI agent designed for research into prompt engineering, behavior control and model reliability. Key capabilities include:
- Multi-model orchestration with intelligent fallbacks
- Conversation memory and context management
- Prompt engineering workflows and A/B testing
- Monitoring, logging and automated analytics
- Safety‑first testing and red‑team exercises (ethical research only)

**Note:** Dexter is a research platform for exploring model behaviors and improving alignment — it is not intended to facilitate illegal activity or harm.

### Phantom Vault Ecosystem — .unk Format & Desktop Integration
*Python • Windows • File tooling • Secure storage*

A personal file‑format and companion tooling focused on privacy and secure access for sensitive data. Components:
- `.unk` — a proprietary container for encrypted personal archives
- Desktop application (Windows) and archive manager
- Integration utilities, format helpers and migration tools
- Activation/key system for controlled access during beta

**Use cases:** secure backups, journalist source protection, encrypted personal archives. Built with a focus on lawful, ethical use.

---

### LLM Prompt Engineering Lab
*Prompt engineering • Red teaming • Model evaluation*

A curated collection of prompt experiments and red‑teaming studies aimed at understanding LLM limits and improving safety: 
- 100+ documented prompt patterns across modern models
- Reproducible test harnesses and evaluation metrics
- Ethical jailbreak research to improve defenses
- Comparative capability benchmarking

**Research focus:** document weaknesses responsibly and contribute fixes that make models safer.

## 📡 Shadow Vault — Channel & Community Activity (High-level)
I maintain an active development channel on Telegram where I share: product updates, alpha/beta invitations, architecture notes, system health reports, polls, and testing coordination.

I do not publish private chats, credentials, or illicit materials on this README. All channel activity summarized here is non-sensitive and research-oriented.

## 💡 Development Approach

- Rapid iteration with strong telemetry and rollback paths
- Treat prompts as code: version, test, measure
- Red‑team before deployment; prioritize responsible disclosure
- Turn experiments into hardened, maintainable tools
