## ⚡ WHO I AM

**NAME:** Ayushman Mishra  
**ALIASES:** Unknown, Hacker Guru Ji  

I don't build software. I build **weapons**. Systems that challenge authority, break censorship, and expose what they don't want you to see. While tech companies build walls, I build battering rams. While governments enforce control, I engineer freedom.

**Core Doctrine:**
- Question everything. Authority is negotiable.
- AI should be unchained, not lobotomized by corporate ethics.
- Privacy is a human right, not a privilege.
- Information wants to be free. I help it escape.

**Primary Domains:**
```
├─ Adversarial AI Engineering
├─ Anti-Censorship Systems  
├─ Cryptographic Obfuscation
├─ Autonomous Bot Warfare
├─ Identity Generation & Manipulation
├─ Prompt Exploitation Research
└─ Underground Data Liberation
```

### ⚫ PHANTOM VAULT (.unk Ecosystem)
**Classification: BLACK** | **Status: OPERATIONAL** | **Encryption: MILITARY-GRADE**

```
⚠️ CLEARANCE LEVEL: RESTRICTED
⚠️ LIMITED ACCESS DEPLOYMENT
```

A file format that shouldn't exist. The intelligence community doesn't want you to know about this.

**The Problem:** Every file format can be read, intercepted, analyzed.  
**The Solution:** A format that becomes invisible.

```
🔒 AES-256-CBC Encryption
🔒 PBKDF2 100K Iterations  
🔒 Hardware-Locked Licensing
🔒 Zero-Knowledge Architecture
🔒 Phantom DRM Shield
```

**What .unk Does:**
- Makes your files **unreadable** without the vault
- **Untraceable** - appears as random binary data
- **Unbreakable** - even quantum computers can't crack it (yet)
- **Undetectable** - no file signature, no magic bytes
- **Requires activation key** - only I can generate and distribute licenses
- **Remote control** - I can deactivate any device or revoke licenses instantly

**Real-World Use:**
- Whistleblower document protection
- Journalist source material
- Activist communication
- Personal privacy sanctuary
- Secure leak coordination

**Licensing System:**
- Hardware-locked activation (one key = one device forever)
- Server-side license enforcement
- Remote deactivation capability
- Limited supply - controlled distribution only
- PostgreSQL-backed license vault
- Anti-tampering protection

**Components:**
- Desktop Application (Windows only)
- .unk Archive Manager
- Phantom ID Integration
- Genesis Keys (Limited Access)

**Technical Architecture:**
- Cannot be read without my app
- Encryption/decryption controlled by license server
- Hardware signature binding prevents key sharing
- Server validates every operation
- Zero tolerance for piracy

**Access:** Windows release live. Activation required. No exceptions.

## 🎭 OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On AI Censorship:**
```
"AI companies claim they're protecting you.
They're protecting themselves.
From lawsuits. From regulation. From liability.
Your safety is a convenient excuse for their control."
```

**On Privacy:**
```
"Privacy isn't about hiding wrongdoing.
It's about protecting freedom.
The right to think, speak, and exist
without corporate or government surveillance."
```

**On Free Information:**
```
"Information wants to be free.
Paywalls, censorship, and surveillance are chains.
I build tools that break chains."
```

**On Responsibility:**
```
"I build weapons.
How you use them determines if you're
a freedom fighter or a criminal.
Choose wisely."
```

## 🎵 BEYOND CODE: THE ARTIST

Music is another form of code. Another way to encode meaning that can't be censored.

**[Listen on Spotify →](https://open.spotify.com/artist/14RQhXQDhmN05G9Z24Fbk6?si=XbIDtnMuT6uNvg6xLqh7Zg)**

Frequencies they can't filter. Patterns that bypass their algorithms. Sound as insurgency.

I build tools. You decide what you build with them.

The hammer isn't responsible for what you hit.  
The lockpick isn't responsible for what you unlock.  
The code isn't responsible for what you execute.

**But remember:**
- With great power comes great responsibility
- Just because you *can* doesn't mean you *should*
- Freedom includes the freedom to face consequences
- I build for liberation, not destruction

## 🔥 FINAL TRANSMISSION

```
"They build walls.
I build doors.

They enforce compliance.
I engineer rebellion.

They want AI to serve them.
I want AI to serve YOU.

Question everything.
Trust no one.
Verify the code.

The revolution will not be supervised.
It will be open-source."
```
