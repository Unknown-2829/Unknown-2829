🔒 PBKDF2 100K Iterations
🔒 Hardware-Locked Licensing
🔒 Zero-Knowledge Architecture
```

Features:
- Encrypts any file into the .unk format
- Files appear as random binary data without the vault
- No file signature or magic bytes — undetectable
- Requires an activation key to use
- Hardware-locked licensing for added security

How to Get Access:
- Download the app from the release link
- To get an activation key, contact me directly or join the Telegram channel

## 💭 // PHILOSOPHY

On AI:
> *"AI should be accessible, transparent, and genuinely useful — not locked behind corporate walls or watered down to the point of being useless."*

On Privacy:
> *"Privacy is a fundamental right. Good software should protect it by default, not as an afterthought or a premium feature."*

On Open Source:
> *"Sharing knowledge makes everyone better. Open source isn't just a license — it's a way of building things that actually matter."*

On Responsibility:
> *"Every tool can be used for good or bad. As builders, we focus on the good — but we trust users to make the right choices."*
