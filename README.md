Welcome — I'm Ayushman (aka Unknown, often called "Hacker Guru Ji"). I build experimental, high-iteration AI systems, Telegram bots, custom file tooling, and prompt engineering experiments. My work lives at the crossroads of practical automation and LLM research: fast prototypes, careful instrumentation, and visuals that look a little dangerous.

## Spotlight — Projects(i also mentioned some projects from private repos)

- telegram-DEXTER-AI — Dexter A (Uncensored AI)  
  A Python Telegram assistant/agent exploring advanced prompt control, uncensored-behavior research, conversation automation, and rapid prototyping for research scenarios.

- Phantom Vault & .unk ecosystem (Phantom_id + .unk-extention)  
  A personal file format (.unk) and companion tooling: a Windows app and utilities to manage a custom personal file type, desktop integration, format helpers, and sync-friendly scripts.

- llm-prompt-engineering — AI Prompt Experiments  
  A curated collection of prompt engineering and red‑teaming experiments across modern LLMs (ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5, etc.) used to test robustness, capabilities, and failure modes.

If any of the above are public and you want them pinned/linked, tell me which ones and I’ll add direct repo links and demo GIFs.

## Core skills & tech

- Python (primary) — bots, automation, tooling  
- Prompt engineering & LLM orchestration  
- Telegram API bots & real-time integrations  
- TypeScript / front-end prototypes (dashboards & control UIs)  
- Safety, red‑teaming & adversarial testing  
- Automation, logging, and observability for small services

---

## How I work

- Iterate fast: small experiments, thorough logging, rapid rollback.  
- Treat prompts like code: version, test, measure.  
- Mix research and product: prototypes that can be hardened into tools.  
- Prioritize invisible safety and clear UX for assistants.
