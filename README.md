Welcome — I'm Ayushman (widely known as Unknown or "Hacker Guru Ji"). I build experimental, high-iteration AI systems, Telegram bots, custom file tooling, and prompt engineering experiments. My work sits at the crossroads of practical automation and LLM research: fast prototypes, careful instrumentation, and visuals that look a little dangerous.

I used insights from your projects (public + private) to shape this profile while keeping private work private and never exposing sensitive details.

---

## Spotlight — Projects
(High-level overviews. I do not expose private internals.)

- telegram-DEXTER-AI — Dexter A (Uncensored AI)  
  Python Telegram assistant/agent focused on advanced prompt control, research-first prototyping, and chat automation.

- Phantom_id & .unk-extention — Phantom Vault / .unk ecosystem  
  A custom .unk file format and companion tools (Windows app + utilities) to manage a personal file type and bespoke workflows.

- llm-prompt-engineering — AI Prompt Experiments  
  Curated collection of prompt engineering and red‑teaming experiments across modern LLMs (used for robustness, capability testing, and research).

If you want these to link to public repos or be shown as pinned cards, tell me which ones are safe to expose and I’ll add direct links.

---

## Core skills & tech

- Python (primary) — bots, automation, tooling  
- Prompt engineering & LLM orchestration  
- Telegram API bots & real-time integrations  
- TypeScript / front-end prototypes (dashboards & control UIs)  
- Safety, red‑teaming & adversarial testing  
- Automation, logging, and observability for small services

---

## How I work

- Iterate fast: small experiments, thorough logging, rapid rollback.  
- Treat prompts like code: version, test, measure.  
- Mix research and product: prototypes that can be hardened into tools.  
- Prioritize invisible safety and clear UX for assistants.

## Aesthetic & Branding

This profile embraces a dark, dangerous look — skulls, bold contrast, and terse copy. Options to enhance the page:
- Animated banner (GIF or SVG) with a black/red palette  
- Demo GIFs for Telegram bot flows  
- Danger / Research badges for experimental projects  
- Icons for the .unk format and Phantom Vault app

If you want a custom banner, provide an image (or say “make an SVG banner”) and I’ll craft one.
